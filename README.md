## Dataset

The [UNICEF Dataset](https://data.unicef.org/resources/resource-type/datasets/) is very interesting and could be a great source for Data Science Projects.

The database includes a large amount of different datasets with important statistics from countries all over the world, spanning the last 14 years. 

Possible applications include creating worldmaps to visualize indicators like diseases, hunger, migration and poverty. It could also be a valuable dataset for NGOs working in developing countries.

## Free Data Science Book

The book [ggplot2 Elegent Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/) by Hadley Wickham, Danielle Navarro, and Thomas Lin Pedersen published by Springer could be great way to start visualizing Big Data with R.
I worked with R and ggplot2 before and its a great tool to analyze data and show the results in a quick and managable way. 
By reading this book I could get an even better understanding of R and could refresh my memory. The github page for the book can be found [here](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book).
